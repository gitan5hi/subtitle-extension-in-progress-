A manifest is a special JSON file that acts as the blueprint or configuration file for the extension.
Tells a browser:
    What the extension is called.
    What version it is
    What files it uses (like scripts, icon, html)
    What permissions it needs
    What pages it should run on

Permissions:
    "activeTab": Grants temporary access to the currently active tab when the user interacts with the extension (like clicking the icon).
        Allows the extension to:
            Read the content of the active tab
            Inject scripts or style into it
            Modify the page temporarily

    "scripting": Gives access to the chrome.scripting API, which is how we inject JavaScript or CSS into web pages.

Extension's toolbar button behavior:
    "default_popup": When the user clicks the extension icon, popup.html will open.
    "default_icon": The icon shown in the toolbar (16x16 pixels here).

Content Script configuration:
    "matches": Specifies which URLs the script should run on. Here, it targets all Youtube videos.
    "js": Lists the JavaScript file(s) to inject. content.js will run on matching pages.

tabCapture: to capture YoutTube audio
background.js: needed to manage recording from the background
